How much code do you need?

(and can you debloat the rest?)

Small programs after 1969 ?
---

* today we don't write much code, we reuse a lot
* sqllite driver
* microcontrollers code
* commodore 64

Small Programs after 1969
---

- The [line mode browser](https://line-mode.cern.ch/) was [pretty small](https://github.com/w3c/libwww)
- Competition code, e.g., 
  - [Flip dots with feelings in 1021 bytes](http://www.p01.org/MONOSPACE/)
  - [A tiny C program](https://bellard.org/mersenne.html)
- Programs for _very_ small things

Application code is big
---

* [Firefox](https://www.openhub.net/p/firefox) is big
* The [Java Virtual Machine](https://www.openhub.net/p/openjdk) is big
* [ffmpeg](https://www.openhub.net/p/ffmpeg) is big (and very [customizable](https://gist.github.com/tayvano/6e2d456a9897f55025e25035478a3a50) :)
* [GAFAs are big](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/millions-lines-of-code/)

Why is code growth a problem ?
---

* code growth is an issue for code quality 
* big code is difficult to maintain
* code growth can be a result of making the code easier to maintain
* bandwidth issues when the code is downloaded
* More dificult to understand and thus more difficult to contribute
* I'd add psychological aspects: developing new code is more fun than maintaining it... so it grows (because many work on development), but nobody (or few) want to maintain it09:30
* building the project (compile, test, package) becomes a problem for large code bases (Cf. the AMA session of yesterday ;-) )

Why does code size grow?
---

* refactoring can make code size grow
* reusing libraries that have a larger API than the one we actually need
* adding new features
* adding new platform support
* obfuscation / make your code look complicate
* keep all versions live / backward compatibility
* code cloning
* we don't remove old code that we don't use anymore (just in case :)
* some managers expect code growth, it's a sign of progress :)

[A Comprehensive Study of Bloated Dependencies in the Maven Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07808)
---

* Intuition: package managers, automatic build encourage software reuse and introduce bloated dependencies


---

[A Comprehensive Study of Bloated Dependencies in the Maven Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07808)
---

* Let's look at one [build file](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jxls/jxls-poi/1.0.15/jxls-poi-1.0.15.pom), for the [jxls library](https://github.com/jxlsteam/jxls/)
* as well as a [build file for a dependency of jxls](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/poi/poi/3.17/poi-3.17.pom)

[A Comprehensive Study of Bloated Dependencies in the Maven Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07808)
---
* 9K artefacts and 700K dependencies
* 75% of dependencies are bloated
* Developers care
    * removed 131 dependencies in 30 projects
    * experiments at SAP and Ericsson ongoing
* [DepClean Maven dependency debloating tool](https://github.com/castor-software/depclean)
* To appear in EMSE journal, 2020.

Conclusion
---

* There is lots of code bloat
    * from libc to Chrome
    * caused by reuse, feature creep, usage, etc.
* Software developers care
    * for security
    * for performance
* It is a relevant research topic
    * that is hard
    * that matters
